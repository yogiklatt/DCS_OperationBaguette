# DCS_OperationBaguette
DCS mission

The mission is currenlty in "editing" mode. In order to export that mission you must do the following:

1) Open the mission in DCS World Editor
2) Open the trigger editor
3) Go to the second trigger from above (DoMissionSetup)
4) You need comment out the following line in the Do Script part:

So instead of 
assert(loadfile("C:\\Users\\jklatt\\Saved Games\\DCS.openbeta\\Missions\\PGOB_scripts.lua"))()

it reads
--assert(loadfile("C:\\Users\\jklatt\\Saved Games\\DCS.openbeta\\Missions\\PGOB_scripts.lua"))()

The line above needs to be there during LUA scripting as it allow to execute the LUA code without having it embedded in the miz file.

5) Create a new Action in the same trigger "Do Script File" and select PGOB_scripts.lua from this repository. This will then embed the LUA file in the miz file.

Remember you can always read all miz contents by opening it with a zip browser.

The contents of the data folder need to go into the l10n folder of the mission file. So if you update the data here, please embed it in the miz file it's up to date.

This mission uses Moose which is embedded in the miz file.

Once you play the mission, after a second you will get a selection of settings to adapt the difficulty via the F-10 comms menu.

BRIEFING CONTENTS
Primary and secondary targets have been stated.

Iranian forces will not attack unless you attack first or violate their border (which we totally will do).

The mission will be conducted as followed:

1) Blue forces launch

2) At point Carcajou you have the option to fuel up at the available tankers for the trip to the AO (roughly 150 nm).

3) At your discretion launch a cruise missile strike to knock out the SAMs between waypoints Carcajou and Crossaint (time to impact is roughly 6 to 8 minutes). The code word for the launch is "Baguetterie" (F-10).

4) Head to the AO. If northbound you might cover behind the mountains north of Havadarya. If south bound be aware of the SAM grid.

5) Commence le attacque!

6) Fly back and land.
